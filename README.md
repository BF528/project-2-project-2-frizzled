# Repository Contents

Each folder indicated the role of the project. The folder contains the script and files used and produced during the process of this analysis.

Data Curator:
  - data_curator_script Linux script used to download samples, extract fastq format, and run fastqc
  - run_extract.qsub used to run the qsub job on SCC to extract fastq format

Programmer:
  - run_tophat.qsub is a shell script (Bash) that aligns the RNA-Seq reads to the mm9 mouse genome reference.
  - run_cufflinks.qsub is a shell script (Bash) that quantifies gene expression.
  - run_cuffdiff.qsub is a shell script (Bash) that calculates differential gene expression.
  - qcmetrics.qsub is a shell script (Bash) that computes read-mapping statistics and other QC plots.
  - histogram.R is an R script that plots the histogram of the FPKM values in the data.
  - histogram.html is a knit document that illustrates the functionality of histogram.R script. 
 
Analyst:
  - BF528_Project2_Analyst_Frizzled.R generates the two histograms of the toal gene set and significant gene set, selected and sorted the significant genes
  - Result_up_rerun.txt/Result_dw_rerun.txt shown the results of DAVID analysis for up-regulated gene set and down-regulated gene set
  
Biologist:
  - BF528_Project2_Biologist.R generates line plots of FPKM values for representative genes for Sarcomere, Mitochondria, and Cell Cycle terms. This file also generates a clustered     heatmap of the top 1000 differentially expressed genes. 

Final Write-Up:
  - PDF document of our final Write-up for Project 2
  - This includes our methods, results, analysis, and conclusions we were able to make based on the data
